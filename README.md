# Home Automation Burglar Detection System

# Objective

When we look at our family, and our home, we know we want them to
be safe, always out of harmâ€™s way. When we leave for work, we expect to
come back to a smiling family, and to a home that is secure. But as they
say, hope is not a strategy. The growing crime rates across cities reflect the
bitter reality. Many people overlook, ignore, and underestimate the need
of taking appropriate home security measures. A burglary or theft can
lead to devastating consequences, both emotionally and financially. The
objective of this project is to provide home security by password protection
and detecting intruders using PIR sensor
